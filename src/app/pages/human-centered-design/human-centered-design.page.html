				<h2>About Human Centered Design</h2>
				<p>
					In the subject HCD there will be learned how to apply the
					IDEO Human Centered Design (HCD) process to iteratively
					develop products or services for the Digital Society. The
					HCD process consists of 3 phases: Inspiration, Ideation and
					Implementation. During the first iteration of the project it
					will become familiar with how to apply these steps.
					Subsequentl the three steps in each of the following three
					iterations are repeated. Furthermore, workshops focusing on
					specific methods of prototyping and user testing will be
					offered in iteration 2-4.
